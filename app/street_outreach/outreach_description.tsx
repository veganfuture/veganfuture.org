        Every two weeks, we take to the streets of Amsterdam to engage
        non-vegans in conversations about the benefits of going vegan. Our
        approach is constantly evolving, with methods like the{" "}
        <Link href="/socialexperiment">Social Experiment</Link>, flyering,
        quizzes, and even selling “dog meat” as a thought-provoking tactic.

        Our core principle is to ensure <b>positive interactions</b>. If someone
        becomes defensive or hostile, we end the conversation politely and
        immediately.

        During conversations, we aim to:

          <li>
            <b>Inform:</b> Explain the ethical reasons to go vegan

            <b>Show:</b> Footage of animal agriculture (not shown to anyone
            under 16)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Provide:</b> Practical resources on going vegan and where to
            learn more

            <b>Leave:</b> A positive impression of veganism and vegans
