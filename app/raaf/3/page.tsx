        <p>RAAF (Revolutionary Animal Advocacy Forum) is back with a third edition!
          We're very excited to announce our speakers, who come from an incredibly broad
          range of animal advocacy styles. From baking cakes to planting mental seeds to planting cameras,
          this is an evening to get inspired by all forms of activism.
        </p><p>
          If you are not yet an activist yourself or find yourself wondering how to energize
          or level up your activism, then RAAF is the #1 event for you. Five speakers will explain
          how they got into activism, what drives them, what challenges they faced, and what
          keeps them busy. They'll inspire you to get going to build the future we all desire â€”
          one in which humanity will recognize that animals are here with us, not for us.
        </p><p>
          After the talks, there will be plenty of time to socialize. We'll enjoy some music, vegan
          snacks, and new connections with like-minded people. We hope to see you there!
        </p>
        <p>
          P.S. If you have any questions about the event, please don't hestitate to <Link href="/contact">contact us</Link>.

            Did you know you have the power to help pigeons right in your own
            neighborhood? Niki Wagner from SOS Duif shares her personal
            experience on how each of us can step up to care for the homeless
            and wild birds living alongside us in the city. From recognizing
            signs of illness to safely freeing pigeons trapped by strings or
            debris, there are simple, legal actions you can take that align with
            animal protection laws. These winged city dwellers often go
            unnoticed, but they depend on our kindness and awareness. By
            understanding how to identify their needs and knowing your legal
            obligations, you can directly improve their wellbeing â€” and make our
            urban environment a kinder place for all creatures. Ready to learn
            how to make a difference? Letâ€™s take action, one pigeon at a time.
