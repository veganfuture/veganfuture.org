Dear {{name}},

Thank you for having joined the second edition of the Revolutionary Animal Advocacy Forum (RAAF #2). We are very content to have hosted another successful event, hopefully you have felt inspired too!

As we announced, RAAF #3 (the autumn edition) will be held on Friday November 28, at the same time and place! Please already mark the date in your calendars :)
As a rule, RAAF events will be hosted every three months on the fourth Friday of the month.

Sign-ups for RAAF #3 have already started: https://veganfuture.org/raaf/3. Furthermore, through our website, our Youtube channel can be found where speeches of former editions are posted, as well as a link to apply as a speaker for one of our next RAAF events.

Lastly, we are looking for volunteers who would be interested in taking part in the RAAF organization team. There are no formal requirements, however, experience and passion for social media, marketing editing, and/or graphic design are a plus.

We wish you a lot of strength in your fight for the animals and look forward to seeing you again in November!

Kind regards,

Esther, Lodewijk and Torben
Organizers RAAF
