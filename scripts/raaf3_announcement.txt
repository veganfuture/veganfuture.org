Arjan Smits – coordinator at Plenty Food Nederland, supporting plant-based food aid worldwide. With a background in tropical forestry and over a decade of activism with the Partij voor de Dieren, he has long been committed to tackling animal testing, industrial farming, and ecological destruction.

More speakers will be announced soon.
