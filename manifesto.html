            <h1>Vegan Future Amsterdam</h1>
            <h2>Mission:</h2>
            <p>To bring about a vegan future with a group of compassionate vegans in peaceful, yet assertive and creative ways.</p>
            <h2>Our vegan stance:</h2>
            <p>We believe all sentient beings have inherent value and deserve respect. In other words, we value sentient beings, because they value themselves.
            By extension we therefore believe farm animals and fish deserve to be protected by rights. It should not be possible to exploit an animal, or rob them of their freedom or life, for optional food, clothing and entertainment.
            We believe the scientific consensus that a well planned vegan lifestyle can be healthy for anyone at any stage of life, either infancy, childhood, pregnancy or old age.
            We operate under the assumption that most people are not intentionally evil, but are simply a product of a non-vegan/carnist culture.
            We promote veganism primarily out of compassion and a sense of justice for animals.
            To be a vegan is and should be doable and does not require you to be a saint. Practicability means something different for all of us, but not paying for animal products, zoos and other unnecessary animal cruelty is what we can all agree on and aspire to.</p>
            <h2>Values:</h2>
            <h3>Non-violence:</h3>
            <p>In order to achieve a violence-free society for all animals, we must use a love-based, nonviolent approach to our activism. Through kindness and love, we can create a positive change. We attempt to skillfully walk the fine line between passiveness and aggressiveness and be assertive, yet always with compassion.</p>
            <h3>Not all or nothing:</h3>
            <p>We’ll encourage any step that moves us closer to a vegan Amsterdam (see “how to create a vegan world”, by Tobias Leenaert). We do what is effective and aspire to stop what is not effective.</p>
            <h3>Diversity:</h3>
            <p>We recognize and welcome diversity of our members, supporters, and people who oppose our organization. Everyone is welcome here, and we accept people at all stages in their journey to adopt a more compassionate life. We have a zero-tolerance policy for oppression of any form toward non-human animals and humans, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, etc.</p>
            <h3>Social, good vibes and fun:</h3>
            <p>Our mission is serious, but that does not mean we can’t have a laugh while working on it. We value the good times so we are well equipped during the bad times.</p>
            <h3>Open source:</h3>
            <p>Everything we do is open-source and available to anyone. Open-source means all our materials are freely and publicly available to everyone and thus anyone is able to spin off their own version of activism based on our material, either in our community or outside it. This way the community can evolve itself and is not dependent on top down leadership.</p>
            <h3>Activists first:</h3>
            <p>We aspire to have a high retention of activists who enjoy being part of our group. This means we put our activists first. If we have to choose between what is effective and what makes/keeps our activists happy, we choose the latter.</p>
            <h3>Friends with all animal rights organizations:</h3>
            <p>We’re all in this together. We actively encourage anyone to participate in any part of the animal rights movement.</p>
            <h2>Organizational structure:</h2>
            <h3>Locality:</h3>
            <p>This group does not have the ambition to grow beyond Amsterdam. We don’t want to become big on purpose. The purpose is to not need a hierarchical power structure.
            The group is totally open-source, so if someone else wants to copy the idea they can freely do so with our help.</p>
            <h3>Money:</h3>
            <p>Any handling of money shall be entirely transparent. At this moment we do not want money to sit in anyone’s bank account for too long. Raising money is purpose driven (e.g. a new TV, printing flyers, etc).</p>
            <h3>Tools:</h3>
            <p>Communication: Whatsapp community group, Event calendar, Animalrightscalendar.org</p>
            <h3>Roles:</h3>
            <h4>Thought leaders:</h4>
            <p>There are always two thought leaders, so no one person can get too much power, who are democratically elected every two years.
            A thought leader is always accountable by anyone to all the values of this group.
            </p><p>
            <b>Responsibilities</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Approve changes to the mission, values, rules and organizational structure with majority consent. Thought leaders must unanimously agree. Changes must be announced to all members and must not be opposed by a majority.</li>
            <li>Approve Pull Requests for the website. Thought leaders must unanimously agree.</li>
            <li>Screen new members who wish to join.</li>
            <li>Have a final say in giving an official warning, temporarily or permanently banning members</li>
            <li>Hold fair and open elections every two years for new thought leaders.</li>
            <li>Hold admin access to all tooling (website, app groups, etc)</li>
            </ul></p>
            <h4>Event organizers:</h4>
            <p>An event organizer is always accountable by anyone to all the values of this group.
            Organizers are not democratically elected. Anyone can become an organizer for any type of event they want.
            There is a minimum of 1 organizer per event type and a maximum of two.
            </p><p>
            <b>Responsibilities</b>:
            <ul>
            <li>Maintain and promote the event calendar</li>
            <li>Make sure the event is well planned, e.g. all equipment in place, etc.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <h3>Joining:</h3>
            <p>
            New members require screening and explicit approval by the thought leaders.
            All people are welcome to join and participate in our events as long as they are vegan or have an interest in transitioning to a vegan lifestyle.
            In order to join our community, you must know and have approved our mission, rules, values and structure. Members must act according to their spirit. Members are free to constructively criticize any part of the manifesto; we are open to improvements.
            If an existing member protests against the joining of a new person, that may be considered a reason to not let the person join. This is part of our activists-first value and is there to protect our activists from toxic relationships spilling over into our group.</p>
            <h3>Getting banned:</h3>
            <p>You can get you banned for hate speech or toxic behavior that objectively harms activists or our cause. Before that happens two official warnings shall be given and the conditions under which a ban shall be described at the second official warning. If a ban happens it will be announced in full transparency to the entire group.</p>
